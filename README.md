## Introduction
This is the second iteration of a health dashboard I have built. The focus on this one was to fully automate the back-end and put less emphasis on the front-end. For that reason, I chose Streamlit since it allows for rapid deployment of simple applications. For a detailed explanation of the back-end data pipeline check out my Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@ericfflynn/a-cloud-based-etl-pipeline-apple-health-data-to-mysql-48391576ce8e) where I explain in-depth the back-end data pipeline.

## Data Sources
All the data utilized in this dashboard was collected by an Apple Watch.
